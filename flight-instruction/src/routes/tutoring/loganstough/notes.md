Outline:

*Personal Minimums Worksheet

*Airspace System
What is required to enter each airspace
ADSB requirements

*Stall/spin awareness
What causes a stall
What causes a spin

*Descent planning
When to calculate the beginning of descent

*Lift production
What creates lift


Notes:

12 minutes late

*Personal Minimums Worksheet Not done, reminded twice to complete

*Lift production
again related it back to pressure and not flow turning tendencies
Explained flow turning again, sent nasa article about It
I think I need to reexplain it, he did not seem to have a firm grasp of it

*Stall/spin awareness
Explained difference in angle of attack from wing root to wingtip
explained aileron inputs and how they can cause spins

*National Airspace System
Class E: stated two way communication required
C: explained that clearance was required
B: understood that student pilots can't fly into bravo and cannot reenter the bravo
needs to review adsb requirements

*Descent planning
I don't think that he gets it
Needs to focus on considerations to make when flight planning


he asked question about TFRs and if he could call the controlling agency about them

quick discussion on NOTAMs and the types of NOTAMs

7/1/2023

Outline:

*Go through personal minimums worksheet

*Go through flight planning process

*Review stalls/spins

*Review lift production

Notes:

13 minutes late

Did not complete personal minimums worksheet, reminded again to complete, said he was called into work late last night

Does not have ipad or computer to use foreflight

*Cross country flight planning
plan flight from KORL to KSPG

Which altitude?


Which course/waypoints?



*He asked about magnetic variaion lines on VFR sectional
asked him about the difference between true and magnetic north
Explained how magnetic north and true north are different
Explained how winds are reported in true north

*Asked about types of fog
Advection fog - had a decent explanation
Radiation fog - 
Reexplained temperature and dewpoint
didn't understand dewpoint
thought lapse rate was 1 per 1000 ft


*Asked him to explain lift production
needs clarification on everything
doesn't really understand what a force is
Stated that the difference in pressure is what causes lift

*Asked him to explain stalls
doesn't fully understand what causes a stall
stated that the higher wing will stall first - explained that it has to do with turning in a direction, not which wing is higher

7/19

Stated a few hours ago that he is not able to meet in person. Asked me if I could go and meet him in a coffee shop again. Said no. Will try to reschedule in person for next week if possible. Will not allow another meeting on discord after this without meeting in person.

Stated that he wants to go over oscars notes, asked him to email them to me before our session. He hasn't responded yet.

Notes:

He is currently driving to a job interview while talking to me on discord. Told me Oscar's notes, he wants to go over:

*AHRS
went through the different instruments located on the AHRS and ADC

*Electrical System
talked about alternator, main, standby battery.
Talked about what is on the essential bus
brief discussion on how the alternator works

*Pitot-Static System

airspeed, vertical speed, altimeter
pitot tube and static port blockages and what indications would show up


*Engine failure above and below 1000 feet


Post notes:

He is confused about the AHRS and ADC, and had trouble describing pitot static system malfunctions.

I went over basic information about what to do during engine failures, he seems to have that pretty well understood, but was lacking in the memory items for the engine failure.

I went over advection fog and radiation fog again. I explained each one in detail. He then attempted to state them back to me and gave me completely incorrect explanations. This is concerning. I have explained it to him a few times in the past, and he still is having trouble with understanding both fog and dewpoint. He was also unable to describe what fog is.

Next time I need to meet with him in person. I am not currently confident in his abilities, and he does not seem to have improved much since we started tutoring. Meeting in person should be more helpful in judging his abilities and maybe in forming a better connection with visual aids.

He has texted me immediately before our sessions on more than two occasions stating that he cannot meet in person. If he is unable to do so on our next session, I'm going to have to deal with it more directly. I'm not sure if he is anxious or it could just be that it is a long way to drive. Either way, I need to set expectations better on what is appropriate, as I am giving my time for free.

I am concerned that he has a learning disability of some kind. I will discuss this further with the flight school.
