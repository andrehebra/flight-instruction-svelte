Outline:

*Personal Minimums Worksheet

*Airspace System
What is required to enter each airspace
ADSB requirements

*Stall/spin awareness
What causes a stall
What causes a spin

*Descent planning
When to calculate the beginning of descent

*Lift production
What creates lift


Notes:

12 minutes late

*Personal Minimums Worksheet Not done, reminded twice to complete

*Lift production
again related it back to pressure and not flow turning tendencies
Explained flow turning again, sent nasa article about It
I think I need to reexplain it, he did not seem to have a firm grasp of it

*Stall/spin awareness
Explained difference in angle of attack from wing root to wingtip
explained aileron inputs and how they can cause spins

*National Airspace System
Class E: stated two way communication required
C: explained that clearance was required
B: understood that student pilots can't fly into bravo and cannot reenter the bravo
needs to review adsb requirements

*Descent planning
I don't think that he gets it
Needs to focus on considerations to make when flight planning


he asked question about TFRs and if he could call the controlling agency about them

quick discussion on NOTAMs and the types of NOTAMs

7/1/2023

Outline:

*Go through personal minimums worksheet

*Go through flight planning process

*Review stalls/spins

*Review lift production

Notes:

13 minutes late

Did not complete personal minimums worksheet, reminded again to complete, said he was called into work late last night

Does not have ipad or computer to use foreflight

*Cross country flight planning
plan flight from KORL to KSPG

Which altitude?


Which course/waypoints?



*He asked about magnetic variaion lines on VFR sectional
asked him about the difference between true and magnetic north
Explained how magnetic north and true north are different
Explained how winds are reported in true north

*Asked about types of fog
Advection fog - had a decent explanation
Radiation fog - 
Reexplained temperature and dewpoint
didn't understand dewpoint
thought lapse rate was 1 per 1000 ft


*Asked him to explain lift production
needs clarification on everything
doesn't really understand what a force is
Stated that the difference in pressure is what causes lift

*Asked him to explain stalls
doesn't fully understand what causes a stall
stated that the higher wing will stall first - explained that it has to do with turning in a direction, not which wing is higher
