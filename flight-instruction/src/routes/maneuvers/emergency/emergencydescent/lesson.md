#Emergency Descent

An emergency descent is utilized during an emergency when a rapid descent is necessary for safety. This maneuver can be incredibly useful to lose a lot of altitude while not overstressing any part of the airplane.

##When to Use an Emergency Descent



##Completion Standards

The completion standards for emergency descents are the same in both the private and commercial ACS. They are shown below:

###Objective

To determine that the applicant exhibits satisfactory knowledge, risk management, and skills associated with an emergency descent.

###Knowledge

*Situations that would require an emergency descent (e.g., depressurization, smoke, or engine fire)
*Immediate action items and emergency procedures
*Airspeed, to include airspeed limitations

###Risk Management

*Failure to consider altitude, wind, terrain, obstructions, and available glide distance
*Collision hazards, to include aircraft, terrain, obstacles, and wires
*Improper airplane configuration
*Distractions, loss of situational awareness, or improper task management

###Skills

*Clear the area
*Establish and maintain the appropriate airspeed and configuration appropriate to the scenario specified by the evaluator and as covered in POH/AFM for the emergency descent
*Maintain orientation, divide attention appropriately, and plan and execute a smooth recovery
*Use bank angle between 30° and 45° to maintain positive load factors during the descent
*Maintain appropriate airspeed +0/-10 knots, and level off at a specified altitude ±100 feet
*Complete the appropriate checklist
