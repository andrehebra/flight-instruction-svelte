#Soft-Field Takeoff

Soft-field takeoffs not only expand your options of where to fly, but they are also a great exercise that will expand your skills as a pilot. Training your skills in precise control of the airplane will make you a better pilot overall.

##What is a Soft-Field Takeoff?

A soft-field takeoff is a technique used by pilots to safely depart from soft landing surfaces such as grass, gravel, or dirt runways. The goal is to keep as much weight off of the landing gear, specifically the nose wheel, as possible to reduce the risk of the wheels digging into the ground and potentially getting stuck.

##Proper Technique

Everything pilots do in a soft-field takeoff, in comparison to a normal takeoff, is to reduce pressure on the landing gear. This is achieved by changing a few things, as shown below.

###Flaps

Set the flaps to 10 degrees. We do this to provide as much lift as quickly as possible during takeoff. Double check this before entering the runway and when lining up.

###Entering the Runway

To enter the runway while minimizing the risk of getting stuck, use minimal braking while applying full aft elevator. Unnecessary braking could cause one of the main landing gears to get stuck in the ground; but also could cause added forces on the nose wheel since braking will cause a nose down force.

###Don't Stop on the Runway

Once you are lined up and have confirmed that you are on the correct runway, smoothly apply full power. Because you have maintained full aft elevator, this will cause the nose to rise up relatively quickly. Counteract this by removing some aft elevator as the nose rises to the appropriate position.

###The Correct Sight Picture

During the ground roll, we want to remove the pressure off of the nose wheel, and we achieve that with a small amount of aft elevator to keep the nose wheel off of the ground. We aren't looking for any kind of aggressive pitch attitude here, especially since it would be relatively easy to cause a tail strike. Look for a pitch attitude that is less than a normal flare on landing.

###The Takeoff Roll

Besides the back pressure on the elevator, everything else about the takeoff until rotation should be like a normal takeoff. Slowly remove crosswind corrections as the controls become more effective, and call out that the airspeed is alive and climbing. Check that the engine instruments are normal and make the "Engine Instruments Normal" call out.

###Rotation

Given our aggressive pitch attitude, the airplane is going to rotate at a slower airspeed compared to normal. This is beneficial as it allows us to completely remove any risk of a nose wheel digging into the ground at a high ground speed. Because of the low speed, however, we want to quickly add some forward pressure on the elevator to remain in ground effect. Because we are at a very low airspeed, we might not be able to fly out of ground effect, meaning that going too high before attaining the proper speed could cause a stall.

###Crosswind Corrections in Ground Effect

Once in ground effect, use a slip to remain on the centerline while properly aligned with the runway. Doing this will reduce the chances of side loading the airplane if for any reason we touch back down on the runway.

###Initial Climb (No Obstacle)

Once reaching 55kts, establish a Vy pitch attitude and retract the flaps as the airspeed increases to 74 kts. Then climb out just as you would with a normal takeoff.

###Initial Climb (Obstacle)

If you are simulating an obstacle, pitch for the obstacle barrier speed of 56kts, similar to a short field takeoff. Once clear, pitch for Vx (62 kts) and retract the flaps. Once the flaps are at 0 degrees, pitch for Vy and resume a normal climb.

##Completion Standards

Below are the completion standards for the private pilot ACS. The only difference between the private and commercial ACS is that the commercial tolerances are ±5 kts instead of +10/-5 kts.

###Objective

To determine that the applicant exhibits satisfactory knowledge, risk management, and skills associated with a soft-field takeoff, climb operations, and rejected takeoff procedures.

###Knowledge

*Effects of atmospheric conditions, including wind, on takeoff and climb performance
*VX and VY
*Appropriate airplane configuration
*Ground effect
*Importance of weight transfer from wheels to wings
*Left turning tendencies

###Risk Management

*Selection of runway based on pilot capability, airplane performance and limitations, available distance, and wind
*Effects of crosswind, windshear, tailwind, wake turbulence, runway surface/condition
*Abnormal operations, to include planning for: rejected takeoff and engine failure in takeoff/climb phase of flight
*Collision hazards, to include aircraft, terrain, obstacles, wires, vehicles, persons, and wildlife
*Low altitude maneuvering including stall, spin, or CFIT
*Distractions, loss of situational awareness, or improper task management

###Skills

*Complete the appropriate checklist
*Make radio calls as appropriate
*Verify assigned/correct runway
*Ascertain wind direction with or without visible wind direction indicators
*Position the flight controls for the existing wind
*Clear the area, maintain necessary flight control inputs, taxi into takeoff position and align the airplane on the runway centerline without stopping, while advancing the throttle smoothly to takeoff power
*Confirm takeoff power and proper engine and flight instrument indications
*Establish and maintain a pitch attitude that will transfer the weight of the airplane from the wheels to the wings as rapidly as possible
*Lift off at the lowest possible airspeed and remain in ground effect while accelerating to VX or VY, as appropriate
*Establish a pitch attitude for VX or VY, as appropriate, and maintain selected airspeed +10/-5 knots during the climb
*Configure the airplane after a positive rate of climb has been verified or in accordance with airplane manufacturer’s instructions
*Maintain VX or VY, as appropriate, +10/-5 knots to a safe maneuvering altitude
*Maintain directional control and proper wind-drift correction throughout takeoff and climb
*Comply with noise abatement procedures

##Common Errors

*Failure to adequately clear the area before taxiing into position on the active runway
*Insufficient back-elevator pressure during the initial takeoff roll, resulting in an inadequate angle of attack
*Failure to cross-check engine instruments for indicators of proper operation after applying power
*Poor directional control
*Allowing the airplane to pitch up excessively, causing a tail strike
*Climbing too steeply after lift-off
*Abrupt and/or excessive elevator control while attempting to level off and accelerate after lift-off
*Allowing the airplane to "mush" or settle, resulting in an inadvertent touchdown after lift-off
*Attempting to climb out of ground effect area before attaining sufficient climb speed
*Failure to anticipate an increase in pitch attitude as the airplane climbs out of ground effect
*Inadequate drift correction after lift-off
