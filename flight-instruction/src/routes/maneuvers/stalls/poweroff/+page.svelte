<Heading tag='h1'>Power-Off Stalls</Heading>
<P>Power-off stalls are normally performed with normal landing approach conditions to simulate an accidental stall during approach to landing. A power-off stall, however, can occur at any airspeed or pitch attitude, and should be comprehensively trained for in a variety of attitudes and flap settings.</P>
<Blockquote border bg class="p-4 my-4"><P size="xl" height="relaxed">NOTE: Before practicing any type of stall, it is imperative to have a full understanding of angle of attack and load factor. This is not a maneuver that you can practice without the prerequisite knowledge.</P></Blockquote>
