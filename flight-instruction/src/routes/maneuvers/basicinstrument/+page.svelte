<Heading tag='h1'>Basic Instrument Maneuvers</Heading>
<P>In this lesson, we will cover the fundamentals of instrument flying, including the various instruments used, how to interpret and use them, and the basic maneuvers required for safe instrument flight. This is by no means a replacement for an instrument rating, it is simply made to ensure that VFR pilots are capable of dealing with unexpected adverse weather.</P>
<Heading tag='h2'>The Hazards of VFR into IMC</Heading>
<P>VFR into IMC, or visual flight rules into instrument meteorological conditions, is a dangerous scenario that can quickly turn fatal for pilots. Entering into an area of low visibility, such as fog or clouds, can quickly lead to spatial disorientation and loss of control. Statistics from the FAA indicate that spatial disorientation is a factor in approximately 15% of general aviation accidents, of which 90% are fatal. Having an understanding of spatial disorientation and the problems it causes can dramatically increase your ability to fly safely. See the article and video below for more information about the insidious nature of spatial disorientation. </P>

<Heading tag='h2'>Spatial Disorientation</Heading>
<P>One of the most insidious aspects of spatial disorientation is that it can happen quickly and without warning. A pilot may feel like they are flying straight and level, when in reality they are turning, climbing, or descending. Without the proper training and equipment, a pilot may have difficulty determining their true orientation and could inadvertently make incorrect control inputs, leading to a loss of control of the aircraft. The FAA brochure linked below briefly discusses how our body maintains its orientation and some of the common types of vestibular illusions.</P>

<P>An important takeaway from the article above is to always trust your instruments when you do not have outside visual references, even if all of your instincts are telling you they are wrong. But first, we need to understand how to properly interpret our instruments.</P>
<Heading tag='h2'>Methods of Attitude Instrument Flying</Heading>
<P>Instrument flying does not come naturally to most people. Understanding the fundamental ideas, however, can help you to become proficient in it relatively quickly. Right now we are going to focus on the two methods of attitude instrument flying that are acceptable, that being the "control and performance" method and the "primary and supporting" method. For more information, see the link below:</P>
<Button href='https://www.faa.gov/sites/faa.gov/files/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aviation/FAA-H-8083-15B.pdf#page=134'>FAA-H-8083-15B Instrument Flying Handbook - Chapter 6</Button>
<Heading tag='h5'>Control and Performance Method</Heading>
<P>From the Instrument Flying Handbook:</P>
<Blockquote border bg class="p-4 my-4"><P size="sm" height="relaxed">Aircraft performance is achieved by controlling the aircraft attitude and power. Aircraft attitude is the relationship of both the aircraft’s pitch and roll axes in relation to the Earth’s horizon. An aircraft is flown in instrument flight by controlling the attitude and power, as necessary, to produce both controlled and stabilized flight without reference to a visible horizon. This overall process is known as the control and performance method of attitude instrument flying.</P></Blockquote>
<P>This method of instrument flying divides the flight instruments into either "control" instruments or "performance" instruments. The general idea being that control instruments display immediate attitude and power indications</P>
<Heading tag='h2'>Completion Standards</Heading>

<P>Basic Instrument Maneuvers are only listed in the Private Pilot ACS. There are six required tasks: </P>
<List ulClass="max-w" tag="ul" class="space-y-1"><Li>Straight-and-Level Flight</Li>
<Li>Constant Airspeed Climbs</Li>

<Li>Recovery from Unusual Flight Attitudes</Li>
<Li>Radio Communications, Navigation Systems/Facilities, and Radar Services</Li></List>
<P>Below are the completion standards as they are listed in the ACS. The last task is not included in this lesson plan, as it is not a maneuver.</P>

<Heading tag='h5'>Knowledge</Heading>
<P>The applicant demonstrates an understanding of:</P>
<List ulClass="max-w" tag="ul" class="space-y-1"><Li>Sensitivity, limitations, and potential errors in unusual attitudes</Li>
<Li>Correlation (pitch instruments/bank instruments)</Li>
<Li>Function and operation</Li>
