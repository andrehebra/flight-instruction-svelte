#Basic Instrument Maneuvers

In this lesson, we will cover the fundamentals of instrument flying, including the various instruments used, how to interpret and use them, and the basic maneuvers required for safe instrument flight. This is by no means a replacement for an instrument rating, it is simply made to ensure that VFR pilots are capable of dealing with unexpected adverse weather.

##The Hazards of VFR into IMC

VFR into IMC, or visual flight rules into instrument meteorological conditions, is a dangerous scenario that can quickly turn fatal for pilots. Entering into an area of low visibility, such as fog or clouds, can quickly lead to spatial disorientation and loss of control. Statistics from the FAA indicate that spatial disorientation is a factor in approximately 15% of general aviation accidents, of which 90% are fatal. Having an understanding of spatial disorientation and the problems it causes can dramatically increase your ability to fly safely. See the article and video below for more information about the insidious nature of spatial disorientation.

##Spatial Disorientation

One of the most insidious aspects of spatial disorientation is that it can happen quickly and without warning. A pilot may feel like they are flying straight and level, when in reality they are turning, climbing, or descending. Without the proper training and equipment, a pilot may have difficulty determining their true orientation and could inadvertently make incorrect control inputs, leading to a loss of control of the aircraft. The FAA brochure linked below briefly discusses how our body maintains its orientation and some of the common types of vestibular illusions.

An important takeaway from the article above is to always trust your instruments when you do not have outside visual references, even if all of your instincts are telling you they are wrong. But first, we need to understand how to properly interpret our instruments.

##Methods of Attitude Instrument Flying

Instrument flying does not come naturally to most people. Understanding the fundamental ideas, however, can help you to become proficient in it relatively quickly. Right now we are going to focus on the two methods of attitude instrument flying that are acceptable, that being the "control and performance" method and the "primary and supporting" method. For more information, see the link below:

!"https://www.faa.gov/sites/faa.gov/files/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aviation/FAA-H-8083-15B.pdf#page=134"FAA-H-8083-15B Instrument Flying Handbook - Chapter 6

###Control and Performance Method

From the Instrument Flying Handbook:

$Aircraft performance is achieved by controlling the aircraft attitude and power. Aircraft attitude is the relationship of both the aircraft’s pitch and roll axes in relation to the Earth’s horizon. An aircraft is flown in instrument flight by controlling the attitude and power, as necessary, to produce both controlled and stabilized flight without reference to a visible horizon. This overall process is known as the control and performance method of attitude instrument flying.

This method of instrument flying divides the flight instruments into either "control" instruments or "performance" instruments. The general idea being that control instruments display immediate attitude and power indications, while performance instruments indicate the aircraft's actual performance. Additionally, navigation instruments are all of the instruments used to determine the aircraft's position in relation to the set navaid.

Control Instruments:
*Attitude Indicator
*Tachometer
*Turn Coordinator

Performance Instruments:
*Airspeed Indicator
*Altimeter
*Vertical Speed Indicator (VSI)
*Heading Indicator

Using this methodology, we can consider all of the changes we want to make in terms of changes in attitude. The instrument flying handbook lays out the four steps to properly make changes:

####Establish

Any time the attitude of the aircraft requires changing, the pilot must adjust the pitch and/or bank in conjunction with power to establish the desired performance. The changes in pitch and bank require the pilot to reference the attitude indicator in order to make precise changes. Power changes should be verified on the tachometer, manifold pressure gauge, etc. To ease the workload, the pilot should become familiar with the approximate pitch and power changes necessary to establish a specified attitude.

####Trim

Another important step in attitude instrument flying is trimming the aircraft. Trim is utilized to eliminate the need to apply force to the control yoke in order to maintain the desired attitude. When the aircraft is trimmed appropriately, the pilot is able to relax pressure on the control yoke and momentarily divert attention to another task at hand without deviating from the desired attitude. Trimming the aircraft is very important, and poor trim is one of the most common errors instructors note in instrument students.

####Cross-Check

Once the initial attitude changes have been made, the pilot should verify the performance of the aircraft. Cross-checking the control and performance instruments requires the pilot to visually scan the instruments, as well as interpret the indications. All the instruments must be utilized collectively in order to develop a full understanding of the aircraft attitude. During the cross-check, the pilot needs to determine the magnitude of any deviations and determine how much of a change is required. All changes are then made based on the control instrument indications.

####Adjust

The final step in the process is adjusting for any deviations that have been noted during the cross-check. Adjustments should be made in small increments. The attitude indicator and the power instruments are graduated in small increments to allow for precise changes to be made. The pitch should be made in reference to bar widths on the miniature airplane. The bank angle can be changed in reference to the roll scale and the power can be adjusted in reference to the tachometer, manifold pressure gauge, etc.

###Primary and Supporting Method

From the Instrument Flying Handbook:

$By utilizing the primary and supporting flight instruments in conjunction with the control and power instruments, the pilot can precisely maintain aircraft attitude. This method utilizes the same instruments as the control/power method; however, it focuses more on the instruments that depict the most accurate indication for the aspect of the aircraft attitude being controlled.

Similar to the control and performance method, all changes to the attitude of the aircraft are made using the attitude indicator and the power instruments.
