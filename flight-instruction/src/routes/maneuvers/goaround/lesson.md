#Go Arounds

Learning how to abort a landing is arguably the most important step in learning how to land safely. While it may seem like a simple task, there are many mistakes that pilots can make that can lead to potentially dangerous situations. This lesson will focus on when to do a go around and common mistakes that people make when attempting them.

Below are the Private Pilot ACS go-around/rejected landing standards. Similar to other takeoff and landing tasks in the ACS, the Commercial ACS simply replaces the +10/-5 knot tolerances with ±5 knots.

###Objective

To determine that the applicant exhibits satisfactory knowledge, risk management, and skills associated with a go-around/rejected landing with emphasis on factors that contribute to landing conditions that may require a go-around.

###Knowledge
The applicant demonstrates an understanding of:

*A stabilized approach, to include energy management concepts
*Effects of atmospheric conditions, including wind and density altitude on a go-around or rejected landing.
*Wind correction techniques on takeoff/departure and approach/landing.

###Risk management

*Delayed recognition of the need for a go-around/rejected landing
*Delayed performance of a go-around at low altitude
*Improper application of power
*Improper airplane configuration
*Collision hazards, to include aircraft, terrain, obstacles, wires, vehicles, vessels, persons, and wildlife
*Low altitude maneuvering including stall, spin, or CFIT
*Distractions, loss of situational awareness, or improper task management

###Skills

*Complete the appropriate checklist
*Make radio calls as appropriate
*Make a timely decision to discontinue the approach to landing
*Apply takeoff power immediately and transition to climb pitch attitude for VX or VY as appropriate +10/-5 knots
*Configure the airplane after a positive rate of climb has been verified or in accordance with airplane manufacturer’s instructions
*Maneuver to the side of the runway/landing area when necessary to clear and avoid conflicting traffic
*Maintain VY +10/-5 knots to a safe maneuvering altitude
*Maintain directional control and proper wind-drift correction throughout the climb
