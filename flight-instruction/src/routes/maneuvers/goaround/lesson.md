#Go-Arounds

Learning how to abort a landing is arguably the most important step in learning how to land safely. While it may seem like a simple task, there are many mistakes that pilots can make that can lead to potentially dangerous situations. This lesson will focus on when to do a go around and common mistakes that people make when attempting them.

##When to Execute a Go-Around

A go-around should be executed whenever any approach and landing parameters deviate from expectations or when it is harzardous to continue. A few common reasons you may need to go around are below:

*Avoiding a conflict on a runway (could be other traffic or any obstruction)
*Not properly aligned with the runway centerline
*Wind shear on final
*Being too fast or too slow
*Being too high or too low
*When something doesn't feel right

Think about it like this: expect to go around, landing is just a bonus. Your flight instructor will never be mad at you for going around, even if there was nothing wrong with your approach. It's always better to be extra cautious. There is no risk in going around, assuming you know how to properly execute one, but there is a lot of risk in continuing an approach that you don't feel comfortable with.

##Don't Delay When Something is Off

There are many reasons why people continue bad landings, however they often happen from two reasons: landing expectancy and pride.

###Landing Expectancy

The belief that conditions are not as threatening as they are and the approach is sure to terminate with a safe landing. This false assumption can affect all pilots, regardless of their experience level. Remember, always take the safe choice, and never underestimate hazards you are facing.

###Pride

Going around is not a failure, in fact it is a good measure of aeronautical decision making. Maybe you're worried about impressing your DPE, or just a passenger. Trust me, neither of them are going to be impressed with you continuing a bad landing and ripping off one of the landing gear. Turning a bad approach into an even worse landing is never a good idea.

##Executing a Go-Around

A proper go-around includes three principles, in this order:

*Power
*Attitude
*Configuration

###Power

This should be your first concern. As soon as you decide to go around, apply full power. You need to overcome the inertia of the airplane's descent and increase your airspeed. Remember that the application of power should be smooth, so don't just slam the throttle forward. 

###Attitude

###Configuration

Below are the Private Pilot ACS go-around/rejected landing standards. Similar to other takeoff and landing tasks in the ACS, the Commercial ACS simply replaces the +10/-5 knot tolerances with ±5 knots.

###Objective

To determine that the applicant exhibits satisfactory knowledge, risk management, and skills associated with a go-around/rejected landing with emphasis on factors that contribute to landing conditions that may require a go-around.

###Knowledge
The applicant demonstrates an understanding of:

*A stabilized approach, to include energy management concepts
*Effects of atmospheric conditions, including wind and density altitude on a go-around or rejected landing.
*Wind correction techniques on takeoff/departure and approach/landing.

###Risk management

*Delayed recognition of the need for a go-around/rejected landing
*Delayed performance of a go-around at low altitude
*Improper application of power
*Improper airplane configuration
*Collision hazards, to include aircraft, terrain, obstacles, wires, vehicles, vessels, persons, and wildlife
*Low altitude maneuvering including stall, spin, or CFIT
*Distractions, loss of situational awareness, or improper task management

###Skills

*Complete the appropriate checklist
*Make radio calls as appropriate
*Make a timely decision to discontinue the approach to landing
*Apply takeoff power immediately and transition to climb pitch attitude for VX or VY as appropriate +10/-5 knots
*Configure the airplane after a positive rate of climb has been verified or in accordance with airplane manufacturer’s instructions
*Maneuver to the side of the runway/landing area when necessary to clear and avoid conflicting traffic
*Maintain VY +10/-5 knots to a safe maneuvering altitude
*Maintain directional control and proper wind-drift correction throughout the climb
