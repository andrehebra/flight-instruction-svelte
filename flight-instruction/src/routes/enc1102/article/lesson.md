When Trevor Jacob decided to stun the aviation world with a masterful display of what not to do as a pilot, many of my fellow aviators found themselves arguing over what Jacob should have done, assuming his made-up situation was at all feasible in the first place. Jumping out of your airplane isn't normally the first priority, at least to those of us who are sane, but the POH of many airplanes seems to be missing a checklist on landing in the middle of a mountain. But do not fear, I'm going to teach you the proper technique, so when you find yourself in such a position, you won't become the laughingstock of the aviation world.

So if the emergency procedures were required to have a mountain landing checklist, what would the steps be? Well, first we're going to have to analyze the circumstances of most mountain landings.

###It's too Steep!
Most pilots get scared when the runway has a grade higher than 3%. I know we have all had some hard landings that have resulted from not properly taking into account the illusions that sloped runways can have. Unfortunately for you, though, things are going to get a little bit more difficult when you have to touchdown on a 20-degree mountainside.

Let's get a few things out of the way first. The moment the engine fails, the airplane belongs to the insurance company. We're not worried about damaging anything other than ourselves and the people who decided it would be a good idea to fly with you. There's a big difference between a comfortable landing and one that you walk away from. In the immortal words of Chuck Yeager:

$"If you can walk away from a landing, it's a good landing. If you use the airplane the next day, it's an outstanding landing." - Chuck Yeager

Unfortunately for us, there isn't too much information about landing on mountainsides. Bush pilots can oftentimes land in crazy spots, but I haven't been able to find many cases of the landing on unforgiving terrain. That being said, we can assume that it doesn't matter as much where we put the plane down, as long as we do it with the minimum amount of energy.

###Go Down in the Trees? Or the Water?

I know we've all had our fair share of hanger arguments when it comes to this question. But let me settle it. Water is water. And no matter where you go it will have the same characteristics. But there are a whole lot of types of trees, and I'm not going to be teaching you a lesson on how to identify each type. I'm also assuming nobody is going to take the time to read an article about it, so here we are.

Water landings have good outcomes most of the time. And while I've seen a lot of good pilots put their planes down in a forest, I've also heard many times where it didn't go that well. Given the circumstances, if all I can see are trees below me with a river passing through, I'll go ahead and take the plunge.

###So What Should I Do?

First of all, don't fly at low altitude above the mountains in a 50-year-old single-engine piston airplane. That's a game of Russian roulette that I don't want to play. Good aeronautical decision-making clearly states that "just because you can, doesn't mean you should."

Other than that, it honestly shouldn't be that different from a normal emergency landing. Declare an emergency, pick a landing spot, and commit to it. Try your best to restart the engine with the remaining time you have. Fully extend the flaps to make the softest landing possible, and if you have a steep spot you might want to even save some energy to start a shallow climb before touchdown.

Best of luck to you!

Also, and this goes without saying, don't stage an event and jump out of an airplane with fire extinguishers in your pant legs. You'll look like an idiot, and also lose your pilot's licesnse. One person already did that, and if I catch another one of you pulling this crap I'm gonna lose it!
