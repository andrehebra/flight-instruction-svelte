#Information Literacy

Being able to properly interpret and come to conclusions is not possible without information literacy. My understanding of information literacy was heavily impacted by the presentation on finding research in the library, which allowed me to properly gauge the credibility of different information sources. 

Credibility, especially with the copious amount of information available online, can be difficult to judge without the proper tools. The Library Research Modules aided in my confidence of being able to understand how relevant my sources were in my Field Investigative Essay, as well as my ability to generate reasons for including sources in my writing.

The most direct display of this learning outcome in action is my annotated bibliography, which is linked below:

Finding relevant sources is no easy task, and combining that with ensuring that each is relevant to the argument that I am constructing made the task quite difficult. However, having a space to justify the sourcing decisions in an organized manner aided in making the assignment easier.

A quote from my annotated bibliography is below:

$This peer-reviewed source discusses the difficulties in maintaining accountability in cultures that are heavily reliant on rules and command/hierarchical systems of responsibility. By highlighting the changing nature of aviation through the relatively new system of “crew resource management (CRM),” rhetoric surrounding causes of accidents, specifically in military and part 121 operations, have shifted dramatically, while the culture in the cockpit has taken far longer to evolve. This will be used to showcase the differences in factual analysis compared to the sentiments and emotionally charged environment often times present in a cockpit during stressful situations and accidents.

My analysis highlights that I am using a peer-reviewed source, which indicates a higher level of credibility. A brief summary of the points made in the source also aided in constructing my argument. Providing reasoning for why the source is included was also beneficial in making sure that no sources were included without a valid reasoning.

Moving forward to Project 2, we were required to heavily rely on information literacy to properly interpret different artifacts that were from new genres and mediums. In the assignment "Field Issue and Rationale Task," I focused on a video of a pilot purposefly crashing his plane while giving misinformation for the reasons the event occured. Secondly, I compared his information to that of an article that was written about him in the news, which refuted the claims that he made.

Quote from my response:

$This video showcases a pilot who purposely caused an engine failure, made no attempts to restart the engine, jumped out of the airplane with a parachute, and let the aircraft crash on its own, potentially killing multiple people. He uploaded the video and attempted to make it seem that the event was not planned, but he lost his pilot's license soon after based on evidence that the event was staged. The aviation community broadly criticized his actions from directly putting people on the ground in danger to making people misunderstand the risks involved in engine failures. Engine failures resulting in forced landings have over a 90% survival rate, making them dangerous, but with a high success rate.

Without my ability to interpret the information that Trevor Jacob was providing, it might not have been possible to come to proper conclusions or search through different sets of evidence which refuted his claims. Information literacy is not only critical in finding information, but also refuting information that is false or potentially harmful.
