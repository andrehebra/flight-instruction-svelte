#Generating Inquiry

Generating inquiry begins with understanding the subjective nature of research, and the ability that all of us have to expand our understanding of a diverse set of topics.

##Reading Response: Genuine Inquiry

A great tool in aiding my understanding of inquiry was the reading response responding to an article titled "What are Research Methods?", which is linked below:

!"https://wac.colostate.edu/docs/books/try/chapter1.pdf"What are Research Methods?

This article was incredibly helpful in expanding my understanding of how research, fundamentally, stems from subjective people asking subjective questions. This went against my view that proper research was entirely subjective.

A quote from my reading response:
$A lot of my preconceived ideas about research have been changed through this reading. I have always considered research to be a highly academic activity, that relies solely on data to find the true answers to different questions. In a sense, I viewed it as a purely objective activity that had no relation to the subjective nature of our lives. But clearly, as subjective people who can only subjectively ask questions, that belief clearly cannot be true. The true nature of research cannot be objective if one is answering a question that was created subjectively. 

This assignment set the foundation for my own research, which was conducted in the field of aviation. Without understanding the true nature of inquiry, it would not have been as effective.

##Project 1 - Field Investigative Essay

Focusing directly on the public perceptions of aviation safety, this project allowed me to investigate many of the common misconceptions that the public have about aviation, and how those views contradict what people in the industry think.

My newfound understanding of inquiry from the reading response allowed me to properly ask questions to the correct people. Through their responses, I was able to properly provide a detailed description of many of the problems in aviation safety perceptions.

Without inquiry, there would be no way of discovering newfound information. But just like anything else, learning how to efficiently and correctly ask questions is the most important step in coming to a correct conclusion.
