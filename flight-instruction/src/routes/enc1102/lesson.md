!"/enc1102/article"Humorous and Informational Article

This article is modeled after the genre conventions of humorous aviation journalism. Paul Bertorelli pioneered this genre convention of providing valuable information to pilot's and the general public that was useful while also being quite humorous. An Example of this genre convention is shown below:

!"enc1102/lesson"Steep Turns Lesson

This lesson follows the common genre conventions of a Certified Flight Instructor lesson plan. It serves to highlight many of the concepts that aspiring pilots have to learn, in comparison to the general understanding that people have of aviation. An Example of this genre convention is shown below:

!"enc1102/graphic"Informational Graphic

These graphics follow the genre convention commonly found in FAA publications. They tend to be more simple and descriptive of a specific process. Many examples of this convention can be found in the handbooks below:

#Rhetorical Rationale

As a field, aviation typically has more strict genre conventions than others. The hierarchical nature of aviation means that most of the information that can be found follows strict guidelines, although this is not true for every medium.

My first genre follows the conventions of a humorous aviation journalism article. While often aviation journalism takes a serious tone, there have been many influential pilots who have gained notoriety for providing valuable information in a comedic way. This goes against the more common convention of serious and dry commentary. Specifically, I focused on the writing of Paul Bertorelli, who has become one of the most popular journalists in the aviation community with a reputation for ridiculous humor and offhand criticism of others.

This lack of seriousness present in Paul's commentary aids in appealing to a broader audience of people outside the aviation community. As discussed in my research paper, misunderstandings of aviation outside of the community can have detrimental effects, and therefore providing well-researched content that could appeal to non-pilots can ameliorate the spread of misinformation. My article focused on providing information about the best methods of landing in a mountainous area in a comedic way. This is intended to keep a reader engaged, even one who might not be as interested in aviation. I also included relatively harsh criticism of Trevor Jacob (discussed in Project 2), as he ditched his airplane while flying above the mountains.

My second genre followed the typical conventions of a Certified Flight Instructor lesson plan that would be delivered to students. In recent years, many services have been created that provide valuable information to student pilots as well as the public. The genre typically follows strict guidelines, where only relevant information is included and the tone is dry. My lesson plan focuses specifically on Steep Turns, a maneuver that is tested on the Private and Commercial practical exams. The goal of this lesson plan is to provide the maximum amount of information that is relevant to the intended lesson without additional content. Visual aids are used to increase understanding and are typically taken from FAA publications (mainly the Pilot's Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge (FAA-H-8083-25B) and the Airplane Flying Handbook (FAA-H-8083-3C).

This genre certainly does not appeal to a broad audience, and therefore there is not much intent on making it engaging. However, the information is public and accessible. For my lesson plan, I included graphics from FAA publications and provided all of the information required to perform steep turns, without going into detail on other topics. I did, however, reference other publications with information, as is common. 

My final genre followed the convention of informational graphics that are used in both FAA publications and aviation journalism to explain concepts.  These are typically accompanied by explanations and are mainly used as a visual aid to learning. All images used in the edits were licensed to me. Below each of the examples is a description of the information that is being conveyed, as would be shown in an article or lesson.

These three genres display various ways that information is presented throughout the aviation community and the public. The ways that information is transmitted throughout the community are critical and can have a massive impact on the perceptions of aviation as viewed from outside of the field. My main goal with these artifacts was to provide useful information that would not only be useful to pilots but also to those wanting to learn more about aviation in general, especially those that might have a fear of flying. Having an understanding of the knowledge that is required in aviation can have a positive impact on whether or not people feel comfortable flying.
