#Airworthiness Requirements

It is always the pilot's responsibility to ensure that an airplane is airworthy. This is a great responsibility, and it determines your own safety and the safety of everyone you carry with you in an aircraft.

##Required Inspections

Required airplane inspections can be remembered by using the acronym: AV1ATES

###Annual
!"https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/part-91/section-91.409#p-91.409(a)"FAR 91.409(a): Annual Inspection
Must be done every 12 calendar months.

Annual inspections can replace 100-hour inspections, but not vice-versa.

Exceptions to this inspection are found in FAR 91.409(c).

Must be carried out by an airframe and powerplant mechanic (A&P).


###VOR (IFR only)

This is required to be done every 30 days, and checks the accuracy of the VORs installed in the airplane.

This is ONLY required for IFR flight.



###100-Hour
!"https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/part-91/section-91.409#p-91.409(b)"FAR 91.409(b): 100-Hour Inspection

This only applies to airplanes that are operated for hire (including flight instruction).

The 100-hour inspection may be exceeded by not more than 10 hours while en route to reach a place where the inspection can be done. The excess time must be included when determining when the next 100-hour inspection is due.


###Altimeter System (24 calendar months)
!"https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/part-91/section-91.411#p-91.411(a)"FAR 91.411(a): Altimeter System

Within the Preceding 24 calendar months, each altimeter instrument, and each automatic pressure altitude reporting system must be tested and inspected.

###Transponder (24 calendar months)
!"https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/part-91/section-91.413#p-91.413(a)"FAR 91.413(a): ATC Transponder Tests and Inspections

Must have been tested and inspected in the preceding 24 calendar months.


###ELT

!"https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/part-91/section-91.207#p-91.207(d)"FAR 91.207(d): ELT Inspections

ELTs must have been inspected within the preceding 12 calendar months.

!"https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/part-91/section-91.207#p-91.207(c)"FAR 91.207(c): ELT Battery Replacement

ELT batteries must be replaced or recharged (if possible) if either of the following conditions are met:
*When the transmitter has been used for more than 1 cumulative hour
*When 50 percent of their useful life has expired (as established by the transmitter manufacturer)

###Static System (24 calendar months)
!"https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/part-91/section-91.411#p-91.411(a)"FAR 91.411(a): Static System

Within the Preceding 24 calendar months, each static pressure system must have been tested and inspected.


###Airworthiness Directives

Additionally, compliance with airworthiness directives is required for an airplane to be airworthy. More information about them is located at the bottom of this page.

##Required Documents

Required Documents onboard an airplane can be remembered with the acronym AROW

###Airworthiness Certificate

Airworthiness certificates are issued by the FAA and deem an aircraft's design to be legal for operation.

It remains valid as long as the airplane meets its approved type design and is maintained.

They do not have an expiration date.

###Registration

Registrations can be thought of in a similar manner to a car's registration.

Before January 23, 2023, registrations were only valid for three years. After that date, they are valid for seven years.

The registration includes the "N number" of the aircraft, which must be displayed on the outside in a visible location.

The paper registration must be located inside of the aircraft in a visible location.

###Operating Limitations

Operating limitations include placards and signs which indicate limitations, gauge indications, and the Pilot's Operating Handbook.

Additionally, the G1000 cockpit reference guide must be inside of the aircraft, but that requirement is set forth in the POH.


###Weight & Balance

Weight and balance documents are required to be on board so that pilot's are able to calculate the airplanes center of gravity and assure that the aircraft is within the proper weight and balance limits set forth in the POH.

##Required Equipment

!"https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-F/part-91/subpart-C/section-91.205"FAR 91.205: Instrument and Equipment Requirements

This section outlines the required operational equipment for different operations.

VFR Day (A TOMATO FLAMES):
*Airspeed indicator
*Tachometer for each engine
*Oil temperature gauge for each air cooled engine
*Manifold pressure gauge for each altitude engine
*Altimeter
*Temperature gauge for each liquid cooled engine
*Oil pressure gauge for each engine using pressure system
*Fuel Gauge
*Landing Gear Position Indicator (if applicable)
*Anti-collision lights (for aircraft certificated after march 11, 1996)
*Magnetic Compass
*ELT
*Safety Belts

VFR Nights (FLAPS):
*Fuses (spare - if applicable)
*Landing Light
*Anti-collision lights
*Position lights
*Source of power

##Inoperative Equipment

!"https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/section-91.213"FAR 91.213: Inoperative Instruments and Equipment

If the aircraft does not have an approved MEL, the following steps must be taken to ensure that the aircraft is airworthy.

*Check if the inoperative equipment is part of the VFR-day type certification instruments and equipment prescribed in the applicable airworthiness regulations under which the aircraft was type certificated
*Check if the inoperative equipment is indicated as required on the aircraft's equipment list, or on the Kinds of Operations Equipment List for the kind of flight operation being conducted
*Check if the inoperative equipment is required by ยง 91.205 or any other rule of this part for the specific kind of flight operation being conducted
*Check if the inoperative equipment is required to be operational by an airworthiness directive

If the equipment is indicated as required on any part of the previous steps, the airplane is NOT AIRWORTHY.

If the equipment is not indicated as required, the following actions must be taken for the airplane to be airworthy:

*Permitted inoperative equipment or instruments must be placarded "INOPERATIVE" prior to any operation
*The letters must be at least 1/8th of an inch high


###Legal vs Safe

Remember, just because inoperative equipment or instruments may not be required does not mean that you have to fly with them not working. The determining factor in flight safety is always the Pilot in Command. If you're not comfortable with the inoperative equipment, ensure that it is fixed before you fly that plane.

##Special Flight Permits

!"https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/section-21.197"FAR 21.197: Special Flight Permits

A certificate authorizing operation of an aircraft that does not currently meet applicable airworthiness requirements but is safe for a specific flight.

This may require an FAA inspector to personally the aircraft or require it to be inspected by an A&P.

These can typically be obtained from the local FSDO (Flight Standards District Office).

Intended to allow an aircraft to be flown to a base where repairs, alterations, or maintenance can be performed.

##Airworthiness Directives and Special Airworthiness Information Bulletins

###Special Airworthiness Information Bulletins (SAIBs)

These are an informational tool that alerts, educates, and makes recommendations to the aviation community. 

These are non-regulatory and are meant to be used as guidance.

Typically used for items that would not be considered serious enough to be included in an airworthiness directive.


###Airworthiness Directives

!"https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/part-91/section-91.417#p-91.417(a)(2)"FAR 91.417(a)(2)(v): Maintenance Records

Airworthiness directives are regulatory in nature and are required to be complied with for an airplane to be airworthy.

$While it is the responsibility of the owner/operator of an aircraft to comply with airworthiness directives, it is STILL THE PILOT'S RESPONSIBILITY TO MAKE SURE THAT THE AIRPLANE IS AIRWORTHY.

Go through the airplanes maintenance records and look through all of the current airworthiness directives to make sure that they are being complied with.
