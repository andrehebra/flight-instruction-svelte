#The Earth's Atmosphere

The basic characteristics of the atmosphere are directly related to weather. Having a full mental picture of the atmosphere can make understanding most weather phenomenon much more simple.

##Composition
Earth's atmosphere consists of various gasses, however the most common are nitrogen and oxygen, which together make up about 99% of the total volume.

It is important to note that these percentages remain the same regardless of altitude. While the density of air will decrease as you go upwards, the concentration of gasses will stay consistent.
