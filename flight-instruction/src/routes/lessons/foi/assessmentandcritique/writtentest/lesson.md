#Written Test Characteristics

A test can only be effective if it has the following characteristics:

##Reliability

The degree to which the test results are consistent with repeated measurements.

##Validity

The extent to which a test measures what it is supposed to measure

##Usability

The ease to which learners are able to take the test. This would include a font that is large enough for learners to read it as well as how clear the wording of questions is.

##Objectivity

The degree to which a question can be graded consistently between different graders. Multiple choice questions are considered more objective than supply type questions because they always have a single correct answer. A supply type question could potentially be interpreted differently depending on the presumptions of the person grading the test.

##Comprehensiveness

The degree to which a test measure the overall objectives

##Discrimination

The degree to which a test distinguishes the difference between learners. A discriminatory test will include: 
*A wide range of scores
*All levels of difficulty
*Items that distinguish between learners with differing levels of achievement of the course objectives
