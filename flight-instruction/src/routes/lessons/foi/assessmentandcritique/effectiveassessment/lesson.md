#Effective Assessment Characteristics

An effective assessment must have the following characteristics:

##Objective
Personal opinions or biases should never be included in any assessment. It needs to focus specifically on the objective that is being measured.

##Flexible
The context of the assessment needs to be taken into account and the variables should be considered. 

##Acceptable
Learners do not like negative feedback. A way to ameliorate this is by being sincere and maintaining a positive attitude. 

##Comprehensive
The degree to which an assessment covers every aspect of a performance is at the discretion of the instructor. It should cover whichever elements would be most beneficial to improving performance in the future.

##Constructive
Without aiding a learner to improve, they gain nothing from an assessment. Simply stating that they did something incorrectly will also be demotivating. Make sure to guide a learner towards better performance.

##Organized
This can come in many different ways, but any assessment should be organized in a logical way. An example would be following the steps taken throughout a maneuver.

##Thoughtful
Never minimize the dignity or importance of the learner being assessed. No assessment should include ridicule, anger, or fun at the expense of the learner.

##Specific
All comments should relate to a specific action. Additionally, make sure to avoid using abstractions.
