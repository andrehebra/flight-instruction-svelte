<Heading tag='h1'>Human Behavior and Effective Communication</Heading>
<P>Understanding human behavior and effective communication is critical in delivering instruction.</P>
<Heading tag='h2'>Definitions of Human Behavior</Heading>
<List ulClass="max-w" tag="ul" class="space-y-1"><Li>An attempt to explain how and why humans function the way they do</Li>
<Li>The product of factors that cause people to act in predictable ways</Li>
<Li>The result of attempts to satisfy certain needs</Li></List>
<P>We are basically looking for certain predictable patters in the way that many people respond and act in certain situations. This does not mean that every person will act the same, but it can explain general ideas in a way that can be especially useful when attempting to teach concepts to a diverse group of people.</P>
<Hr class="my-8" height="h-px" />
<Heading tag='h2'>Human Needs</Heading>
<P>All human needs can be thought of as the things that a person requires for normal growth and development. These needs are satisfied in order of importance. Maslow's Hierarchy of Human Needs is a great outline of human needs and the order in which they can be satisfied:</P>
<Button href='humanbehaviorandeffectivecommunication/humanneeds'>Explanations of Each Human Need</Button>
<List ulClass="max-w" tag="ul" class="space-y-1"><Li>Physiological Needs</Li>
<Li>Security</Li>
<Li>Belonging (social needs)</Li>
<Li>Esteem (internally and externally)</Li>
<Li>Cognitive and Aesthetic</Li>
<Li>Self-Actualization</Li></List>
<Hr class="my-8" height="h-px" />
<Heading tag='h2'>Motivation</Heading>
<P>Motivation is the reason that a person acts or behaves in a certain way. It determines the amount of effort a person will put in to reach their goals.</P>
<Heading tag='h5'>Where does Motivation Come From?</Heading>
<P>Motivation, including the motivation to want to become a pilot, can come from various sources. Some people just love airplanes, while others see it as a path to improve their technical skills. Some people simply like to learn new things.</P>
<P>Whatever the case may be, it is important that an instructor understands a learner's motivations and can tailor their instruction to them. Keeping motivation high during training will improve outcomes and keep every interaction fresh.</P>
<Heading tag='h5'>Maintaining Motivation</Heading>
<P>There is not one single way to motivate all people. Instead, look into incorporating the following ideas into your training:</P>

<Hr class="my-8" height="h-px" />
<Heading tag='h2'>Defense Mechanisms</Heading>
<P>Defense mechanisms are an unconscious psychological operation that functions to protect a person from anxiety-producing thoughts and feelings related to internal conflicts and outer stressors. These directly go against an instructors ability to properly teach.</P>

<Heading tag='h2'>Anxiety and Stress / Emotional Reactions</Heading>
<Heading tag='h5'>Anxiety</Heading>
<P>Anxiety is a feeling of worry, nervousness often about something that is going to happen.</P>
<P>Reactions to anxiety can vary, but generally there are a few ways in which people react to stress.</P>
<Heading tag='h5'>Normal Reactions to Stress</Heading>
<P>Rapid and exact response within the limits of the experience and training</P>
<Heading tag='h5'>Abnormal Reactions to Stress</Heading>

<Li>Rapid changes in emotions</Li>
<Li>Extreme over-cooperation</Li>
<Li>Severe anger directed towards the flight instructor, service personnel, and others</Li>
<Li>Inappropriate laughter or singing</Li>
<Li>Marked changes in mood on different lessons</Li></List>
<Heading tag='h5'>Seriously Abnormal Students</Heading>
<P>If an instructor believes a student may be suffering from a serious psychological abnormality, they have a responsibility to refrain from instructing that student.</P>
<P>Additionally, the instructor has the responsibility of assuring that this person does not continue flight training. Possible steps to achieve this goal are:</P>
<List ulClass="max-w" tag="ul" class="space-y-1"><Li>Arrange for another instructor to conduct an evaluation flight. That way, you can both determine whether or not further investigation or action is required</Li>
<Li>Do not endorse a student who you believe to be exhibiting seriously abnormal psychological conditions</Li></List>
<Hr class="my-8" height="h-px" />
<Heading tag='h2'>Effective Communication</Heading>
<P>Effective communication is extremely important in flight instruction, not only to properly transfer information in a way that a learner can understand, but also in minimizing the amount of time wasted during instruction. If endorsements have already been provided, they should be withheld</P>
<Heading tag='h5'>Basic Elements of Communication</Heading>
