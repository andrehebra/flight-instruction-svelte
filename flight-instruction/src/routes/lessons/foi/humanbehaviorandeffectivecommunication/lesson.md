#Human Behavior and Effective Communication

Understanding human behavior and effective communication is critical in delivering instruction.


##Definitions of Human Behavior

*An attempt to explain how and why humans function the way they do
*The product of factors that cause people to act in predictable ways
*The result of attempts to satisfy certain needs

We are basically looking for certain predictable patters in the way that many people respond and act in certain situations. This does not mean that every person will act the same, but it can explain general ideas in a way that can be especially useful when attempting to teach concepts to a diverse group of people.

##Human Needs

All human needs can be thought of as the things that a person requires for normal growth and development. These needs are satisfied in order of importance. Maslow's Hierarchy of Human Needs is a great outline of human needs and the order in which they can be satisfied:

*Physiological Needs
*Security
*Belonging (social needs)
*Esteem (internally and externally)
*Cognitive and Aesthetic
*Self-Actualization

##Motivation

Motivation is the reason that a person acts or behaves in a certain way. It determines the amount of effort a person will put in to reach their goals.

##Defense Mechanisms
