#Elements of Communication

While there are many different models of communication, the Aviation Instructors Handbook breaks down the elements of communication into source, symbols, and receiver.

##Source

$It is the responsibility of the speaker or writer, as the source of communication, to realize that the effectiveness of the communication is dependent on the receiver’s understanding of the symbols or words being used.

The source of communication is the sender, speaker, writer, encoder, transmitter, or instructor. We can break down the effectiveness of a source into three parts:

1. Their ability to to select and use language. It is important that an instructor use terminology that is meaningful to listeners and readers. Understanding that most learners will not be familiar with aviation concepts, instructors cannot assume an understanding of commonly used terminology.

2. The source needs to be confident and illustrate that their message is important. During all communication, the communicator reveals information about themselves, including their self-image and view of the ideas being communicated.

3. Their use of up-to-date and stimulating material. Fresh information will always be more interesting, and will help keep the attention of the person you are communicating with.

##Symbols

Symbols include the codes that are used to convey different meanings. It could be anything from oral to tactile codes. Additionally, facial expressions or gestures also convey different meanings.

Communication uses all of these different codes in what we refer to as "channels," which can be divided into visual, auditory, or kinesthetic. It is important to use many different channels to effectively get a message across.

$The instructor may gain and retain the learner’s attention by using a variety of channels. As an example, instead of telling a learner to adjust the trim, the instructor can move the trim wheel while the learner tries to maintain a given aircraft attitude. The learner experiences by feel that the trim wheel affects the amount of control pressure needed to maintain the attitude. At the same time, the instructor can explain to the learner that what is felt is forward or back pressure on the controls. After that, the learner begins to understand the correct meaning of control pressure and trim, and when told to adjust the trim to relieve control pressure, the learner responds in the manner desired by the instructor.

Instructors need to consistently monitor learner reactions to the use of different symbols, codes, and channels as to make sure there is no confusion or misunderstanding.

##Receiver

The receiver is the listener, reader, decoder, or learner. Communication only succeeds in relation to the reaction of the receivers. Effective communication can be seen as successful when the receiver reacts with understanding and changes their behavior according to the intent of the source.

Instructors need to understand the three characteristics of receivers to communicate properly, which are:

1. Abilities: abilities of a learner need to be understood to communicate properly. For example, some learners will have a greater familiarity related to aviation topics compared to others. The same communication style between those people can not be the same as one learner may not understand terminology or symbols in the same way that another would.

2. Attitudes: learner attitudes can vary dramatically from resistance to willingness. A varied communication approach is needed to mold a learners attitudes into ones that promote reception of information.

3. Experiences: Aviation learners are generally adults with a high sense of motivation and self-concept compared to other learners. Instructors need to tailor their communication style to match one that fits in with their previous life experiences.
