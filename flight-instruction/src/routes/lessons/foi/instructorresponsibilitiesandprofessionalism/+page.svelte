<Heading tag='h1'>Instructor Responsibilities and Professionalism</Heading>
<Blockquote border bg class="p-4 my-4"><P size="sm" height="relaxed">The aviation instructor is the central figure in aviation training and bears responsibility for all phases of required training. The instructor, either pilot or aircraft maintenance technician, needs to be a professional. As professionals, aviation instructors strive to maintain the highest level of knowledge, training, and currency in the field of aviation. To achieve this goal, instructors need to commit themselves to continuous, lifelong learning and professional development through study, service, and membership in professional organizations</P></Blockquote>
<P>Instructors need to hold themselves to high standards to ensure that a learner is becoming a competent and safe pilot while also doing it in a cost effective manner.</P>
<Heading tag='h2'>Responsibilities of All Aviation Instructors</Heading>
<List ulClass="max-w" tag="ul" class="space-y-1"><Li>Helping Learners Learn</Li></List>
<P>Make sure that every lesson is a positive experience. Learners naturally experience satisfaction by doing a good job. Making sure that the learning is interesting will keep a learner motivated, especially when going into difficult tasks. Additionally, learners should be given clear objectives at the start of each lesson so that they can prepare and organize what they are going to learn and understand their expectations.</P>
<List ulClass="max-w" tag="ul" class="space-y-1"><Li>Providing Adequate Instruction</Li></List>
<P>To provide adequate instruction, an instructor needs to analyze the learner's personality, thinking and ability. Each learner needs to be looked at as an individual with their own specific needs. For example, a quiet or reserved learner can be mistaken for a slow learner, however this would be a fault on the instructor as they have failed to understand the personality of the learner. There is not one single correct way to teach a concept, the correct method of instruction needs to always be tailored to the strengths of the learner.</P>
<List ulClass="max-w" tag="ul" class="space-y-1"><Li>Demanding Appropriate Standards of Performance</Li></List>
<P>The ACS and PTS are not teaching documents, they are testing documents. An instructor always needs to develop their own reasonable standards for each student that corresponds to their ability and also continues to reasonably challenge them. Properly assigned standards will continue to motivate a learner and encourage them to always strive for improvement.</P>
<List ulClass="max-w" tag="ul" class="space-y-1"><Li>Emphasizing the Positive</Li></List>
<P>Fear is contrary to proper instruction and learning. Introducing and engine failure by pulling out the throttle on the first lesson without warning will leave a learner scared and with a negative image of aviation. This will dramatically decrease motivation. Learners should definitely prepare for possible negative experiences, but these need to be handled in a positive manner as to not create fear. There is nothing in aviation that demands a learner suffer as a part of their instruction. Aviation instructors need to hold themselves to a standard of giving a positive image of aviation.</P>
<List ulClass="max-w" tag="ul" class="space-y-1"><Li>Ensuring Aviation Safety</Li></List>
<P>Safety is the most important priority. It is the instructor's responsibility to make sure that a learner is able to maintain a safe environment and take responsibility for their safety in all areas of aviation.</P>
<Heading tag='h2'>Flight Instructor Responsibilities</Heading>
<List ulClass="max-w" tag="ul" class="space-y-1"><Li>Evaluation of Learner Piloting Ability</Li>
<Li>Pilot Supervision</Li>
<Li>Practical Test Recommendations</Li>
<Li>Flight Instructor Endorsements</Li>
<Li>Additional Training and Endorsements</Li>
<Li>Pilot Proficiency</Li>
<Li>See and Avoid Responsibility</Li>
<Li>Learner's pre-solo Flight Thought Process</Li></List>
<Hr class="my-8" height="h-px" />
<Heading tag='h2'>Minimizing Learner Frustration</Heading>
<P>This comes down to encouraging learners rather than discouraging them. Frustration on the part of the learner will reduce motivation and keep them from achieving their goals in aviation.</P>
<List ulClass="max-w" tag="ul" class="space-y-1"><Li>Motivate Learners</Li></List>
<P>Make sure that a learner understands the reasons for learning a particular thing. This will keep them interested and motivated throughout their training. Not every single thing you teach will be interesting to a learner, but by emphasizing why a particular topic needs to be understood, it can keep a learner working towards their ultimate goal.</P>
<List ulClass="max-w" tag="ul" class="space-y-1"><Li>Keep Learners Informed</Li></List>
<P>Make sure that a learner understands what their expectations are for each lesson and assessment. A learner will feel insecure when they are not properly informed about their situation.</P>
<List ulClass="max-w" tag="ul" class="space-y-1"><Li>Approach Learners as Individuals</Li></List>
<P>Each learner has a unique personality and instruction needs to be modified accordingly. Instructing in the same way for everyone will create instruction that doesn't work for anyone.</P>
<List ulClass="max-w" tag="ul" class="space-y-1"><Li>Give Credit When Due</Li></List>
<P>Make sure to give credit and be supportive when a learner does a good job. This will keep them motivated and assured that the instructor is recognizing their efforts.</P>
<List ulClass="max-w" tag="ul" class="space-y-1"><Li>Criticize Constructively</Li></List>
<P>It does not help to point out mistakes without providing an explanation. A learner needs to understand why a specific procedure was done incorrectly for them to correct it.</P>
<List ulClass="max-w" tag="ul" class="space-y-1"><Li>Be Consistent</Li></List>
<P>Learners want to please their instructor, and this cannot be done when the learner doesn't understand what the expectations are. If something is acceptable one day and unacceptable the next, the learner will become confused and lose confidence in the instructor.</P>
<List ulClass="max-w" tag="ul" class="space-y-1"><Li>Admit Errors</Li></List>
<P>Admit when you are wrong or make a mistake. This will not only make sure that the learner is learning correct things, but it will also increase the learners confidence in the instructor by showing that you also make mistakes and are able to admit when you are wrong.</P>

<Li>Demand unreasonable progress</Li>
<Li>Forget the learner is new to aviation jargon</Li>
<Li>Set the learner up for failure</Li>
<Li>Correct errors without an explanation of what went wrong</Li></List>
<Heading tag='h5'>Acceptance of the Learner</Heading>
<P>An instructor needs to accept learners as they are, including their faults and problems. The learner wants to learn, and the instructor needs to help them along in that process. Make sure that both the instructor and learner are working towards the same objective, and under no circumstance do anything which implies degrading the learner. Always treat the learner with respect, whether or not they are a fast learner.</P>
<Hr class="my-8" height="h-px" />
<Heading tag='h2'>Evaluation of Student Ability</Heading>
<P>Evaluation refers to judging a learner's ability to perform a maneuver or procedure.</P>
<Heading tag='h5'>Demonstrated Ability</Heading>
<P>Evaluation of demonstrated ability is based on established standards of performance modified to apply to the learner's experience and stage of development as a pilot. The evaluation needs to consider the learner's mastery of the elements involved in the maneuver or procedure, rather than just the overall performance.</P>
<Heading tag='h5'>Keeping the Learner Informed</Heading>
<P>When evaluating, the instructor needs to keep the learner informed of progress. This can be done as each maneuver is completed, or summarized during a postflight or class critique. These should be in a written format. When critiquing, make sure to explain proper corrections and how the learner can improve.</P>
