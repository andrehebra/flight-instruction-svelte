#The Learning Process

Learning can be defined in many different ways, but generally we are talking about:

*A change in behavior of the learner as a result of experience
*The process of experience which brings about a relatively permanent change in behavior
*gaining knowledge, skills, or developing a behavior through study, instruction, or experience

##Learning Theory

The explanation of how people acquire skills, knowledge, and attitudes. There are two accepted concepts of how people learn: Behaviorism and Cognitive Theory.

###Behaviorism
Explains animal and human behavior in terms of observable and measurable responses to stimuli. Can be generally thought of as a system of rewards and punishment which causes people to learn. This system stresses the importance of positively rewarding behavior that an instructor deems acceptable in the learner.

Behaviorism has been losing some popularity more recently because learning can be described as a much more complex process compared to simply rewards and punishments.

###Cognitive
In this theory, we focus on what is going on in the mind of a learner, considering:

*Knowing
*Perceiving
*Problem Solving
*Decision-Making
*Awareness
*Etc.



###Concepts in Cognitive Theory:

*Reflective Thought
One main focus of cognitive theory is reflection. Learning improves because a learner is able to reflect on their own performance. This is useful to the degree that a learner is able to understand their own mistakes.

*Assimilation and Accommodation
Tension between old ideas meeting new situations and changing old ideas to meet the new situations, or showing that the old ideas hold up to new situations.

*Spiral Curriculum
Revisiting basic ideas repeatedly and building on them in more sophisticated ways will cause students to mature and develop


###Blooms Taxonomy of the Cognitive Domain

comprises levels of intellectual behavior and progress from the simplest to the most complex

*Knowledge
Being able to recollect the information which was learned.
*Comprehension
Demonstrate comprehension through one or more forms of explanation.
*Application
Use information or a skill in a new situation.
*Analysis
Break material into its constituent parts and determine how the parts relate to one another and/or to an overall structure or purpose.
*Synthesis and Evaluation
Make judgments based on criteria and standards and evaluate one's own or other's performance.

##Perceptions and Insight

All learning initially comes from perceptions, which are directed to the brain by one or more of the five senses.

###Factors that affect perception:

*Physical Organism
*Goals and Values
*Self-concept
*Time and Opportunity
*Element of Threat

###Insight

The grouping of perceptions into meaningful wholes. It is the instructor's responsibility to ensure that insights occur during instruction.

Insights will occur whether or not instruction is taking place, the difference is that the instructor can dramatically increase the speed at which the insights are created.

##The Laws of Learning

*Readiness
The basic needs of the learner need to be satisfied before he or she is ready or capable of learning. The instructor can not do much to motivate a learner if those needs have not been met.

*Effect
The law of effect states that behaviors that lead to satisfying outcomes are likely to be repeated whereas behaviors that lead to undesired outcomes are less likely to recur. The learner needs to have success in order to have more success in the future. The instructor needs to create situations designed to promote success by using positive training experiences

*Exercise
Connections are strengthened with practice and weakened when practice is discontinued. Essentially, "use it or lose it"

*Primacy
What is learned first often creates a strong and almost unshakable impression and underlies the reason an instructor needs to teach correctly the first time

*Intensity
Exciting or dramatic learning connected to a real situation teaches a learner more than a routine or boring experience

*Recency
The most recently learned thing is best remembered
