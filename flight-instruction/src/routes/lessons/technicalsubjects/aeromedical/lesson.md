##Medical Certificates

###How to Obtain a Medical Certificate

Medical Certificates are granted by Aviation Medical Examiners (AMEs). They can be searched for in a specific area by using the FAA's "Find an Aviation Medical Examiner" website:

Additionally, feel free to ask your instructor if they can recommend an AME in your area.

Certain conditions may disqualify a person from obtaining a Medical Certificate, however, there are situations where these can be accounted for through a special issuance or a statement of demonstrated ability. More information about this can be found in the link below:

###Certificate Validity

Medical Certificates are designated from first to third class, with each granting the holder specific operating permissions.

Learner's wishing to work in Part 121 operations should apply for a first class medical to make sure that they are able to obtain one before engaging in costly training.
