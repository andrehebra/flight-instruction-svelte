#Aeromedical Factors

Physical and mental health are vital to the safe operation of an airplane, and are also one of the parts that new pilots are most anxious about.

##Medical Certificates

###How to Obtain a Medical Certificate

Medical Certificates are granted by Aviation Medical Examiners (AMEs). They can be searched for in a specific area by using the FAA's "Find an Aviation Medical Examiner" website:

!"https://www.faa.gov/pilots/amelocator"FAA AME Locator

Additionally, feel free to ask your instructor if they can recommend an AME in your area.

Certain conditions may disqualify a person from obtaining a Medical Certificate, however, there are situations where these can be accounted for through a special issuance or a statement of demonstrated ability. More information about this can be found in the link below:

!"aeromedical/disqualifyingconditions/"Disqualifying Conditions and Special Issuance/Statement of Demonstrated Ability

###Certificate Validity

Medical Certificates are designated from first to third class, with each granting the holder specific operating permissions.

Learner's wishing to work in Part 121 operations should apply for a first class medical to make sure that they are able to obtain one before engaging in costly training.

A breakdown of medical certificate classes and validity is below:

###BasicMed

BasicMed allows a pilot to legally operate without a valid medical certificate. The requirements are outlined in the link below:

###Dealing With Health Conditions in Relation to a Medical Certificate

Remember that just because you have a medical certificate, you cannot operate an aircraft if you are currently experiencing a condition that would not allow you to obtain that same medical certificate again. Beyond the legal aspect, it is important to understand that any condition will have a negative impact on your performance and should be considered before taking the responsibility of flying an airplane.

##Hypoxia

A state of oxygen deficiency in the body sufficient to impair functions of the brain and other organs. See the information below for the symptoms of hypoxia:

!"aeromedical/effectsofhypoxia"Effects and Symptoms of Hypoxia

###Hypoxic Hypoxia

Caused by increased pressure altitude or a blocked airway. Can be thought of as not enough oxygen being able to enter into the lungs. This is the most common occurrence of hypoxia in aviation. 


###Hypemic Hypoxia

Caused by blood not being able to take up oxygen and transport it. Carbon monoxide poisoning is an example of this. The hemoglobin in your body will bind to the Carbon Monoxide instead of oxygen, and therefore transport it instead.


###Stagnant Hypoxia

Caused by the circulatory system not being able to circulate enough oxygenated blood throughout the body. This could be caused by high g maneuvers in airplanes, where the body can't push oxygenated blood into the brain.

Additionally, stagnant hypoxia can be caused by diseases like sickle cell anemia, or hypothermia, which causes blood vessels to constrict.


###Histotoxic Hypoxia

Caused by cells not being able to use the oxygen that is transported to it. This can often times be caused by the use of alcohol or drugs which impair cell functions in accepting oxygen.

The best example of this would be cyanide poisoning, which directly prevents cells from using oxygen and is fatal.

##Hyperventilation

Hyperventilation is a rapid or deep breathing that is generally caused by anxiety or panic. The excessive breathing can lead to low levels of carbon dioxide in your blood, which causes many of the symptoms that you may feel if you hyperventilate.
