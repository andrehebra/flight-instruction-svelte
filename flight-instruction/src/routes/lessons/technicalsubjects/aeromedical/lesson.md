#Aeromedical Factors

Physical and mental health are vital to the safe operation of an airplane, and are also one of the parts that new pilots are most anxious about.

##Medical Certificates

###How to Obtain a Medical Certificate

Medical Certificates are granted by Aviation Medical Examiners (AMEs). They can be searched for in a specific area by using the FAA's "Find an Aviation Medical Examiner" website:

!"https://www.faa.gov/pilots/amelocator"FAA AME Locator

Additionally, feel free to ask your instructor if they can recommend an AME in your area.

Certain conditions may disqualify a person from obtaining a Medical Certificate, however, there are situations where these can be accounted for through a special issuance or a statement of demonstrated ability. More information about this can be found in the link below:

!"aeromedical/disqualifyingconditions/"Disqualifying Conditions and Special Issuance/Statement of Demonstrated Ability

###Certificate Validity

Medical Certificates are designated from first to third class, with each granting the holder specific operating permissions.

Learner's wishing to work in Part 121 operations should apply for a first class medical to make sure that they are able to obtain one before engaging in costly training.

A breakdown of medical certificate classes and validity is below:

!"aeromedical/certificatevalidity"Medical Certificate Validity


###BasicMed

BasicMed allows a pilot to legally operate without a valid medical certificate. The requirements are outlined in the link below:

!"aeromedical/basicmed/"BasicMed Information

###Dealing With Health Conditions in Relation to a Medical Certificate

Remember that just because you have a medical certificate, you cannot operate an aircraft if you are currently experiencing a condition that would not allow you to obtain that same medical certificate again. Beyond the legal aspect, it is important to understand that any condition will have a negative impact on your performance and should be considered before taking the responsibility of flying an airplane.

##Hypoxia

A state of oxygen deficiency in the body sufficient to impair functions of the brain and other organs. See the information below for the symptoms of hypoxia:

!"aeromedical/effectsofhypoxia"Effects and Symptoms of Hypoxia

###Hypoxic Hypoxia

Caused by increased pressure altitude or a blocked airway. Can be thought of as not enough oxygen being able to enter into the lungs. This is the most common occurrence of hypoxia in aviation. 


###Hypemic Hypoxia

Caused by blood not being able to take up oxygen and transport it. Carbon monoxide poisoning is an example of this. The hemoglobin in your body will bind to the Carbon Monoxide instead of oxygen, and therefore transport it instead.


###Stagnant Hypoxia

Caused by the circulatory system not being able to circulate enough oxygenated blood throughout the body. This could be caused by high g maneuvers in airplanes, where the body can't push oxygenated blood into the brain.

Additionally, stagnant hypoxia can be caused by diseases like sickle cell anemia, or hypothermia, which causes blood vessels to constrict.


###Histotoxic Hypoxia

Caused by cells not being able to use the oxygen that is transported to it. This can often times be caused by the use of alcohol or drugs which impair cell functions in accepting oxygen.

The best example of this would be cyanide poisoning, which directly prevents cells from using oxygen and is fatal.

##Hyperventilation

Hyperventilation is a rapid or deep breathing that is generally caused by anxiety or panic. The excessive breathing can lead to low levels of carbon dioxide in your blood, which causes many of the symptoms that you may feel if you hyperventilate.

##Middle Ear and Sinus Problems

Sinus issues and ear pain are common in flight due to the rapid changes in pressure that are normally experienced. It is important to understand how to deal with these problems for both the pilot and passengers.

##Spatial Disorientation

Spatial disorientation refers to anytime a pilot loses orientation with regard to the position, attitude, or movement of the airplane in space. Spatial disorientation can be divided into many different categories, as explained in the link below:

!"aeromedical/spatialdisorientation"Spatial Disorientation

Additionally, it is important to understand how the inner ear helps us to maintain orientation. See the link below for more information:

###Optical Illusions

There are also many different optical illusions that can be hazardous for pilots. See the link below for more information:

##Motion Sickness

Motion sickness arises from the body receiving conflicting messages about its orientation. Remember that our bodies were not designed to be in flight, and therefore will not naturally be accustomed to all of the different forces involved in even a calm flight.

###Motion Sickness in Learners

Motion sickness is common in new pilots who are flying for the first time. Especially in light aircraft. It will generally go away after the first few lessons.

Once a learner becomes sick, however, it is important to stop instructing and make them comfortable. People can not learn when they are sick, and there is no point in needlessly making someone uncomfortable.

Anxiety and stress will also contribute to motion sickness.

###Symptoms of Motion Sickness

Symptoms include:
*General discomfort
*Nausea
*Dizziness
*Paleness
*Sweating
*Vomiting

###Treating Motion Sickness
*Open air vents
*Focus outside the airplane on a distant object
*Avoid unnecessary head movements

If the symptoms of motion sickness persist beyond the first few lessons, it is important to consult an AME and suspend training until adequately treated.

##Carbon Monoxide Poisoning

Carbon monoxide poisoning causes hypemic hypoxia and is incredibly dangerous.

Carbon monoxide is in exhaust fumes, which means that if exhaust fumes are able to enter into the cabin it could be easily inhaled.

Carbon monoxide is colorless, odorless, and tasteless, meaning that you will not be able to tell if you are inhaling it. Combining that with the difficulty in identifying symptoms of hypoxia, it can easily become fatal.

###Detecting Carbon Monoxide

Many newer ADS-B receivers have carbon monoxide alarms included with them. You should test the alarm on it so that you can quickly identify the noise.

Additionally, many aircraft have carbon monoxide detectors installed in them. However, these will not have an audible alarm and need to be consistently monitored for a change in color. An example of one is shown below: 

&dfa041ca-ae18-440f-c601-fa77dce9de00

###Dealing with Carbon Monoxide

If you detect the smell of exhaust fumes, or have an indication on a carbon monoxide monitor immediately turn off the cabin heat, open air vents and windows, and land as soon as possible.

Seek medical treatment after landing.
