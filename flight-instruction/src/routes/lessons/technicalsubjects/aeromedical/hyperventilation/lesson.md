#Hyperventilation

Hyperventilation in aviation is generally caused by panic or anxiety. It is important to understand it as it could happen to a pilot or a passenger.

##What is Happening

When some people experience stress, they may begin to breath rapidly. Additionally, hyperventilation itself can be a stressful experience, leading to more hyperventilation. The diagram below outlines the "hyperventilation cycle"

###Carbon Dioxide Expulsion

When hyperventilating, the body rapidly expulses carbon dioxide. With a normal breath rate (approx. 12 breaths per minute), the body produces the same amount of carbon dioxide as it is releasing through the lungs.

As the concentration of carbon dioxide decreases in the body, blood pH increases from its normal level and becomes alkalotic. This increase in pH is what causes the symptoms of hyperventilation.
