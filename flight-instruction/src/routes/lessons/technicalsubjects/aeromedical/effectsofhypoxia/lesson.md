#Effects of Hypoxia

Hypoxia affects everyone differently, which can make it difficult or even impossible to tell when you are being affected by it. Hypoxia can occur rapidly or gradually, and it is important to understand the risks.

##Video

The video linked below shows someone entering into a hypoxic state. You can see that he is gradually losing concentration and becomes unable to identify basic things. 

Additionally, notice that the person does not seem to be nervous or worried about his worsening condition, as he is unable to notice his loss of brain function.

##Dangers of Hypoxia

The true danger of hypoxia is that a person can often times not notice their own worsening condition. With almost any other risk or condition, proper attention can generally minimize the level of danger. However, hypoxia can creep in without the victim even noticing.

Once the person is in an impaired state, they can become unable to help themselves or make safe decisions.

##When to Use Supplemental Oxygen

In part 91 operations, supplemental oxygen is required under the following conditions:

*Above a cabin pressure altitude of 12,500 to 14,000 feet MSL: flight crews are required to use supplemental oxygen for flights exceeding 30 minutes at these altitudes
*Above a cabin pressure altitude of 14,000 feet MSL: flight crew must use supplemental oxygen
*Above a cabin pressure altitude of 15,000 feet MSL: passengers must be provided with supplemental oxygen, however they are not required to use it

###Legal vs Safe

Remember that the above requirements are only the legal minimum. It is recommended to use supplemental oxygen at pressure altitudes above 10,000 feet MSL during the daytime and 5,000 feet MSL during nighttime.
