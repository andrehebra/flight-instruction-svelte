Similar to direction signs, destination signs have a yellow background and a black inscription which indicates a destination on the airport.

Common indicated destinations are:
*Runways
*Aprons
*Terminals
*Military areas
*Civil aviation areas
*Cargo areas
*FBOs

Destination signs will have an arrow that points in the direction of the destination. An example of a destination sign that points towards a military area is below: 

&4d07517c-ede6-49b1-6b0a-64fbe64fea00

##Multiple Destinations

If two destinations are in the same direction, it is common to have a sign that lists both with a dot in between them. An example of this is shown below, where two runways are in a similar direction:

&22cd1e01-1223-4320-1678-0c78fddf4f00

If the destinations are not along the same route or far away from one another, they will be divided with a black line, as shown below: 

&9a72fe7a-d703-4e82-7708-1308e7cd3000
