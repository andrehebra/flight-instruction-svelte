#Runway Incursion Avoidance

A runway incursion is any occurrence at an airport involving an aircraft, vehicle, person, or object on the ground that creates a collision hazard or results in a loss of separation with an aircraft taking off, landing, or intending to land.

Proper planning can prevent runway incursions and the possibility of ground collisions.

There are about 3 runway incursions each day at towered airports in the United States, of which 65% are caused by pilots (according to the FAA).
