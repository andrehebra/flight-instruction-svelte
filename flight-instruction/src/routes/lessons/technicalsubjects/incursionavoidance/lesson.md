#Runway Incursion Avoidance

A runway incursion is any occurrence at an airport involving an aircraft, vehicle, person, or object on the ground that creates a collision hazard or results in a loss of separation with an aircraft taking off, landing, or intending to land.

Proper planning can prevent runway incursions and the possibility of ground collisions.

There are about 3 runway incursions each day at towered airports in the United States, of which 65% are caused by pilots (according to the FAA).

##Contributing Factors to Runway Incursions

There are three main contributing factors that lead to runway incursions:
*Communications
*Airport knowledge
*Flight deck procedures for maintaining orientation

###Common Deviations that Lead to Runway Incursions

{Pilot Deviations}
*Crossing a runway hold marking without a clearance
*Taking off without a clearance
*Landing without a clearance

{Operational Incidents}
*Clearing an aircraft onto a runway while another aircraft is landing on the same runway
*Issuing a takeoff clearance while the runway is occupied by another aircraft or vehicle

{Vehicle Deviations}
*Crossing a runway hold marking without a clearance
