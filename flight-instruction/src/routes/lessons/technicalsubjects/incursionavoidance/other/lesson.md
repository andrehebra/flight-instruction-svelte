##Vehicle Roadway markings

Vehicle roadway markings are used to define a path for vehicle operations on or crossing areas that are also intended for aircraft.

These markings consist of a white solid line to delineate each edge of the roadway and a dashed line to separate lanes within the edges of the roadway.

Zipper markings can also be used to delineate the edges of the vehicle roadway.

##VOR Receiver Checkpoint Markings

The VOR receiver checkpoint consists of a painted circle with an arrow in the middle, which is aligned in the direction of the checkpoint azimuth.

This marking, and associated sign, will be located on the airport apron or taxiway at a specific point.

##Nonmovement Area Boundary Markings

These markings delineate the movement area and the nonmovement area.

Remember, the movement area is the area where ATC clearances are required, while the nonmovement area is uncontrolled.

The boundary consists of two yellow lines (one solid and one dashed) 6 inches in width. The solid line is located on the nonmovement area side, while the dashed yellow line is located on the movement area side. A depiction is below:

##Marking and Lighting of Permanently Closed Runways and Taxiways

Lighting circuits will be disconnected for closed runways and taxiways.

The runway threshold, runway designation, and touchdown markings will be obliterated.

Yellow crosses will be placed at the end of the runway and at 1,000 foot intervals.

##Temporarily Closed Runways and Taxiways

When a runway is temporarily closed, yellow crosses will be placed on each end of the runway.

These could also be raised crosses.

Additionally, a visual indication may not be present depending on the reason for the closure. ALWAYS check the NOTAMs and the ATIS for runway closure information.

When a taxiway is closed, it will either be barricaded, or have yellow crosses installed at the entrance to the taxiway.
