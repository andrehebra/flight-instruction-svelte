##Taxiway Edge Lights
These outline the edges of taxiways during darkness or restricted visibility conditions.

Edge lighting is blue, and can often times be adjusted at controlled airports on request.



--
##Taxiway Centerline Lights

These are used to facilitate ground traffic under low visibility conditions.

They are located along the taxiway centerline in straight line portions, on the centerline of curved portions, and along designated taxiing paths in portions of runways, ramp, and apron areas.

Centerline lights are steady burning and emit green light.

##Clearance Bar Lights

These are installed at holding positions on taxiways to make them clear.

These are three in-pavement steady-burning yellow lights.



--
##Runway Guard Lights
These are installed at taxiway/runway intersections.

They are primarily used to enhance the conspicuity of taxiway/runway intersections during low visibility conditions, cut can be used in all weather conditions.

They consist of either a pair of elevated flashing yellow lights on either side of the taxiway, or a row of in-pavement yellow lights installed across the entire taxiway at the runway holding position marking.



--
##Stop Bar Lights

Stop bar lights are normally used in low visibility conditions (below 1,200 feet RVR).

They consist of a row of red, unidirectional, steady-burning in-pavement lights across the entire taxiway at the runway holding position.

NEVER cross an illuminated stop bar, even if you have an ATC clearance.
